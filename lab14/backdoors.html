    <h1>Backdoors</h1>
    <p> Backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer,
        product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm,
        chipset, or even a "homunculus computer" â€”a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT
        technology).
        Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in
        cryptosystems.
        From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on
        hard drives,
        or transfer information within autoschediastic networks. </p>
    <p>A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program,
        a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit),
        code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows.
        Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear
        to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor.
        Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors
        have "legitimate" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords. </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The threat of backdoors surfaced when multiuser and networked operating systems became widely adopted.
        Petersen and Turn discussed computer subversion in a paper published in the proceedings of the 1967 AFIPS
        Conference.
        They noted a class of active infiltration attacks that use "trapdoor" entry points into the system to bypass
        security
        facilities and permit direct access to data. The use of the word trapdoor here clearly coincides with more
        recent definitions
        of a backdoor. However, since the advent of public key cryptography the term trapdoor has acquired a different
        meaning
        (see trapdoor function), and thus the term "backdoor" is now preferred, only after the term trapdoor went out of
        use.
        More generally, such security breaches were discussed at length in a RAND Corporation task force report
        published under
        ARPA sponsorship by J.P. Anderson and D.J. Edwards in 1970.</p>
    <p>A backdoor in a login system might take the form of a hard coded user and password combination which gives access
        to the system.
        An example of this sort of backdoor was used as a plot device in the 1983 film WarGames, in which the architect
        of the "WOPR" computer
        system had inserted a hardcoded password-less account which gave the user access to the system, and to
        undocumented parts of the system
        (in particular, a video game-like simulation mode and direct interaction with the artificial intelligence). </p>
