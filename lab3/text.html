        <h2>What Is Antivirus Software</h2>
        <p>Antivirus software (abbreviated to AV software), also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware. </p>
        <p>Antivirus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses, hence the name. However, with the proliferation of other malware, 
           antivirus software started to protect against other computer threats. Some products also include protection from malicious URLs, spam, and phishing.</p>
        <h2>Unexpected Renewal Costs</h2>
        <p>Some commercial antivirus software end-user 
            license agreements include a clause that the subscription will be automatically renewed, and the purchaser's credit 
            card automatically billed, at the renewal time without explicit approval. For example, McAfee requires users to unsubscribe 
            at least 60 days before the expiration of the present subscription while Bitdefender sends notifications to unsubscribe 30 days before the renewal.
            Norton AntiVirus also renews subscriptions automatically by default.</p>
