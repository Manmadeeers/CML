    <h2>njRAT virus</h2>
    <h3>What is njRAT?</h3>
    <p>njRAT, also known as <span style="color:black ; font-size: large;">Bladabindi</span>, is a remote access tool
        (RAT) with user interface
        or trojan which allows
        the holder of the program to control the end-user's computer. It was first found in <span
            style="color:black;font-size: large;">June 2013</span> with some variants traced to November 2012.
        It was made by a hacking organization from different countries called M38dHhM and was often used against targets
        in the Middle East.
        It can be spread through phishing and <span style="color:black; font-size: large;">infected drives</span>.
        To date, there are many versions of this <a href="Second.html">virus</a>, the most famous of which is <span
            style="color:black;font-size: large;">njRAT Green Edition</span>. </p>
    <h3>About the program and it's whereabouts</h3>
    <p>A surge of <span style="color:gray; font-size:x-large;">njRAT attacks</span> was
        reported in India in July 2014. In an attempt to disable njRAT's capabilities, Microsoft took down four million
        websites in 2014 while
        attempting to filter traffic through no-ip.com domains.In March 2016, Softpedia reported that spam camp
        aigns spreading remote access trojans such as njRAT were targeting Discord. In October 2020, Softpedia al
        so reported the appearance of a cracked VMware download that would download njRAT via Pastebin. Terminating the
        process would crash the computer.
        An Islamic State website was hacked in March 2017 to display a fake Adobe Flash Player
        update download, which instead downloaded the njRAT trojan.

    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>NjRAT, like many remote access trojans, works on the principle of a reverse backdoor, that is, it requires open
        ports on the attacker's computer.
        After creating the malware (client) and opening it, the attacker's server receives a request from the client
        side.
        After a successful connection, the attacker can control the victim's computer by sending commands to the server
        when the client part processes them. </p>

        update download, which instead downloaded the njRAT trojan.
