    <h2>njRAT virus</h2>
    <h3>What is njRAT?</h3>
    <p>njRAT, also known as Bladabindi, is a remote access tool (RAT) with user interface or trojan which allows
        the holder of the program to control the end-user's computer. It was first found in June 2013 with some variants
        traced to November 2012.
        It was made by a hacking organization from different countries called M38dHhM and was often used against targets
        in the Middle East.
        It can be spread through phishing and infected drives.
        To date, there are many versions of this virus, the most famous of which is njRAT Green Edition.</p>
    <h3>About the program and it's whereabouts</h3>
    <p>A surge of njRAT attacks was reported in India in July 2014. In an attempt to disable njRAT's capabilities,
        Microsoft took down four million
        websites in 2014 while
        attempting to filter traffic through no-ip.com domains.In March 2016, Softpedia reported that spam camp
        aigns spreading remote access trojans such as njRAT were targeting Discord. In October 2020, Softpedia al
        so reported the appearance of a cracked VMware download that would download njRAT via Pastebin. Terminating the
        process would crash the computer.
        An Islamic State website was hacked in March 2017 to display a fake Adobe Flash Player
        update download, which instead downloaded the njRAT trojan.
        In January 2023, outbreaks of Trojan infections were seen in the Middle East. The attackers used .cab
        files with supposedly political conversation, when opened, they launched a .vbs script that downloaded malware
        from the cloud.</p>
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>NjRAT, like many remote access trojans, works on the principle of a reverse backdoor, that is, it requires open
        ports on the attacker's computer.
        After creating the malware (client) and opening it, the attacker's server receives a request from the client
        side.
        After a successful connection, the attacker can control the victim's computer by sending commands to the server
        when the client part processes them.</p>
