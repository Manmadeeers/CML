         <h2><font face="Arial Narrow">njRAT virus</font></h2>
         <h3>What is njRAT?</h3>
         <p ><font color = "blue" face = "Arial">njRAT, also known as <span style="color:black ; font-size: large;" >Bladabindi</span>, is a remote access tool (RAT) with user interface or trojan which allows 
            the holder of the program to control the end-user's computer. It was first found in <span style="color:black;font-size: large;">June 2013</span> with some variants traced to November 2012.
             It was made by a hacking organization from different countries called M38dHhM and was often used against targets in the Middle East. 
             It can be spread through phishing and <span style="color:black; font-size: large;">infected drives</span>.
             To date, there are many versions of this <a href="Second.html">virus</a>, the most famous of which is <span style="color:black;font-size: large;">njRAT Green Edition</span>.</font> </p>
         <h3>About the program and it's whereabouts</h3>
         <p><font color="red" face="Comic Sans MS">A surge of <span style="color:gray; font-size:x-large;">njRAT attacks</span> was reported in India in July 2014. In an attempt to disable njRAT's capabilities, Microsoft took down four million
            websites in 2014 while 
            attempting to filter traffic through no-ip.com domains.In March 2016, Softpedia reported that spam camp
            aigns spreading remote access trojans such as njRAT were targeting Discord. In October 2020, Softpedia al
            so reported the appearance of a cracked VMware download that would download njRAT via Pastebin. Terminating the 
            process would crash the computer.
            An Islamic State website was hacked in March 2017 to display a fake Adobe Flash Player
             update download, which instead downloaded the njRAT trojan.
            In January 2023, outbreaks of Trojan infections were seen in the Middle East. The attackers used .cab 
            files with supposedly political conversation, when opened, they launched a .vbs script that downloaded malware
             from the cloud.</font></p>
         <h3>Architecture</h3>
         <p><font color="green" face="Times New Roman">NjRAT, like many remote access trojans, works on the principle of a reverse backdoor, that is, it requires open ports on the attacker's computer.
             After creating the malware (client) and opening it, the attacker's server receives a request from the client side.
             After a successful connection, the attacker can control the victim's computer by sending commands to the server when the client part processes them. </font></p>
