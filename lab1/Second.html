            <h3>Trojan horse(computing)</h3>
            <div>I<p>In computing, a Trojan horse is any malware that misleads users of its true intent by disguising itself as a standard program.
                 The term is derived from the ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.</p>

                T<p>rojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering.
                For example, where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on a fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else.
                Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller who can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer.
                Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a Trojan.
                Unlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves. </p></div>
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <div>Once installed, Trojans may perform a range of malicious actions. Many tend to contact one or more Command and Control (C2) servers across the Internet and await instruction. 
                 Since individual Trojans typically use a specific set of ports for this communication, it can be relatively simple to detect them.
                 Moreover, other malware could potentially "take over" the Trojan, using it as a proxy for malicious action.
                 Due to the popularity of botnets among hackers and the availability of advertising services that permit authors to violate their users' privacy, Trojans are becoming more common. 
                 According to a survey conducted by BitDefender from January to June 2009, "Trojan-type malware is on the rise, accounting for 83% of the global malware detected in the world." 
                 Trojans have a relationship with worms, as they spread with the help given by worms and travel across the internet with them.</div>
