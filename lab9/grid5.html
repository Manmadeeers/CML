        <div style="grid-area: y2 z2;">A grid is simply a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a pattern
            against which we can line up our design elements. They help us to create designs where elements don’t jump
            around or change width as we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on our websites.

            A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each row and column — commonly referred to
            as gutters.At the present time the majority of grid type layouts are created using floats. If you have read
            our previous article about floats, you’ve already seen how we can use this technique to create a multiple
            column layout — which is the essence of any grid system using this method.</div>
        <div style="grid-area: y3 z3;">In order to ensure a consistent experience across your site or application,
            basing it upon a grid system from the outset means you don’t need to think about how wide a certain element
            is in relation to the other elements. Your choice is limited to “how many columns of the grid this element
            will span”.</div>
