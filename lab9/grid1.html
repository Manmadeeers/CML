        <div class="cl2">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
            be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for its appearance.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects
            the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The
            World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,
            has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as
            HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript. </div>
        <div class="cl3">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of
            a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
            XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
            fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
            the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
            and its formatting. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style
            rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is
            predictable. </div>
