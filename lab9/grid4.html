        <div style="grid-area: y2;">A grid system is a set of guidelines and rules that define the structure, alignment,
            and proportion of elements on a web page. A grid system usually consists of rows, columns, gutters, margins,
            and breakpoints, which create a modular and flexible grid that can adapt to different screen sizes and
            devices. A grid system can help you organize your content, create hierarchy and contrast, and ensure
            consistency and readability.When it comes to web design, there are many grid systems to choose from
            depending on your preferences and needs. Bootstrap is a popular and widely used framework that provides a
            12-column grid system, as well as many responsive and customizable components and utilities.Foundation is
            another popular framework that offers a 12-column grid system, plus advanced features and plugins.
            Additionally, CSS Grid is a native CSS feature that enables complex and flexible grid layouts with minimal
            code; while Flexbox is another native CSS feature that allows you to create one-dimensional grid layouts
            that can be aligned and distributed in various ways.</div>
        <div style="grid-area: y3">A framework is a collection of pre-made components, styles, and scripts that you can
            use to build your web pages faster and easier. A framework usually includes a grid system, as well as
            typography, buttons, forms, navigation, icons, and other common UI elements. A framework can help you save
            time and effort, follow best practices, and ensure compatibility and accessibility.</div>
