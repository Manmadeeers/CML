        <div class="cl1">In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a
            system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
            Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in
            late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint
            request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,
            Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first
            entry.[4]

            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on
            the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
            relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,
            an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these
            elements still exist in HTML 4.[8] After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created
            an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification
            intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]Further
            development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML
            specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
            published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in
            the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the
            W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[14]

        <div class="cl2">Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the
            HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly
            described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another
            file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML. And additionally, as more and more devices
            are able to access responsive web pages, different screen sizes and layouts begin to appear. Customizing a
            website for each device size is costly and increasingly difficult. The modular nature of CSS means that
            styles can be reused in different parts of a site or even across sites, promoting consistency and
            efficiency. </div>

        <div class="cl3">Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by
            the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
            specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which
            included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six months,
            but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
            reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's
            competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
            already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]</div>
